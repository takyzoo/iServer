# iServer for Pythonista by GoDzM4TT3O

***

## What is iServer?
### iServer is a script made for Pythonista 3 by GoDzM4TT3O on 18 August 2018. It starts a server (by default) on port 80.

***

## How can I start iServer?
### Go to startserver.py, then click on the 'run' icon. It will both start your local server and open a WebView UI, in which you will view the contents of your server.

***

## Now that my server started, it's empty!
### You need to add an index.html file. You can use [iEditor for Pythonista](https://github.com/GoDzM4TT3O/iEditor) for a simple html template.

***

## I want to change the port of my server!
### To change the port, go to startserver.py, then find the string 'PORT' and change it. The default port is 80. Now go to iServer.py, and find the string 'URL', then add a column ':' and the number of your port.

***

## How do I install iServer?
### Use iServerGet.py
